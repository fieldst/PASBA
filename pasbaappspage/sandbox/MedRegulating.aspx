<p class="pageTitle">Medical Regulating</p>
     
    

       <div>
          <p>Medical Regulating is a casualty-management system designed to coordinate the movement of patients - from the site of injury or onset of disease - through successive echelons of medical care to medical treatment facilities that can provide appropriate levels of medical treatment.</p>
        </div>

<p class="contentHeader">Theater Evacuation Policy</p>
           
          <ol class="firstOL">
              <li>Establishes, in number of days, the maximum period of non-effectiveness (hospitalization and convalescence) that patients may be held                   within the theater for treatment.<br/><br/></li>
              <li>The evacuation policy is set by the Secretary of Defense with advice from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and recommendations from the Theater                   Commander.<br/><br/></li>
              <li>The period starts when a patient is admitted to a corps-level hospital.</li>
